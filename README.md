Own SCSS Structure
This is my own SCSS boilerplate created from scratch. It is partially forked from a SaaS solution where I removed all theme-specific styling. There are still some styles left, such as paragraph and body styling, which should be tailored to your own needs or provided by the designer. Nevertheless, this boilerplate provides a very solid starting point with most of the things and conventions you will need to start off with a theme.

I might try and create a LESS version one day to experiment.
