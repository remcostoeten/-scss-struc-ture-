This is my own SCSS boilerplate created from scratch. It is partially forked from a SaaS solution, from which I removed all theme-specific styling. There are still some styles remaining, such as paragraph and body styling, which should be tailored to your needs or provided by the designer. Nevertheless, this boilerplate provides a solid starting point with most of the necessary things and conventions you'll need to start with a theme.

I may try to create a LESS version one day to experiment.
